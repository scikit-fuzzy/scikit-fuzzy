Getting started
---------------

``scikit-fuzzy`` is an fuzzy logic Python package that works with
:mod:`numpy` arrays. The package is imported as ``skfuzzy``: ::

    >>> import skfuzzy

though the recommended import statement uses an alias: ::

    >>> import skfuzzy as fuzz

Most functions of ``skfuzzy`` are brought into the base package namespace.
You can introspect the functions available in ``fuzz`` when using IPython by::

    [1] import skfuzzy as fuzz
    [2] fuzz.

and pressing the :strong:`Tab` key.

Finding your way around
-----------------------

A list of submodules and functions is found on the `API reference
<../api/index.html>`_ webpage.

Within :mod:`scikit-fuzzy`, universe variables and fuzzy membership functions are
represented by :mod:`numpy` arrays. Generation of membership functions is
as simple as: ::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import skfuzzy as fuzz
    >>> x = np.arange(11)
    >>> mfx = fuzz.trimf(x, [0, 5, 10])
    >>> x
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])
    >>> mfx
    array([ 0. ,  0.2,  0.4,  0.6,  0.8,  1. ,  0.8,  0.6,  0.4,  0.2,  0. ])

While most functions are available in the base namespace, the package is
factored with a logical grouping of functions in submodules. If the base
namespace appears overwhelming, we recommend exploring them individually.
These include

``fuzz.membership``
  Fuzzy membership function generation

``fuzz.defuzzify``
  Defuzzification algorithms to return crisp results from fuzzy sets

``fuzz.fuzzymath``
  The core of :mod:`scikit-fuzzy`, containing the majority of the most common
  fuzzy logic operations.

``fuzz.intervals``
  Interval mathematics. The restricted Dong, Shah, & Wong (DSW) methods for
  fuzzy set math live here.

``fuzz.image``
  Limited fuzzy logic image processing operations.

``fuzz.cluster``
  Fuzzy c-means clustering.

``fuzz.filters``
  Fuzzy Inference Ruled by Else-action (FIRE) filters in 1D and 2D.
