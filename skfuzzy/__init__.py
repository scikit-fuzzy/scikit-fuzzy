"""
scikit-fuzzy (a.k.a. `skfuzzy`): Fuzzy Logic Toolbox for Python.

This package implements many useful tools and functions for computation and
projects involving fuzzy logic, also known as grey logic.

Most of the functionality is actually located in subpackages, but like numpy we
bring most of the core functionality into the base namespace.
