scikit-fuzzy
============

`scikit-fuzzy` is a fuzzy logic toolkit for SciPy.

The goals of scikit-fuzzy are:
* To provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and
  implemented fuzzy logic algorithms
* To increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to
  closed-source options.

Installation
------------

Scikit-Fuzzy depends on
  
  * Matplotlib >= 3.1
  * NumPy >= 1.6
  * SciPy >= 0.9
  * NetworkX >= 1.9

and is available on PyPi! The latest stable release can always be obtained
and installed simply by running

    $ pip install --upgrade scikit-fuzzy

which will also work to upgrade existing installations to the latest release.


If you prefer to install from source or develop this package, you can fork and
clone this repository then install SciKit-Fuzzy by running

	$ pip install --editable .

IEEE Rounding for Matlab users
------------------------------

It should be noted that Matlab rounds incorrectly. The IEEE standard (which is
how this package behaves) requires rounding to the nearest EVEN number if
exactly between, e.g. 1.5 --> 2; 2.5 --> 2; 3.5 --> 4; 4.5 --> 4, etc. This
minimizes systematic rounding error. Thus, if re-implementing algorithms from
Matlab code, slight inconsistencies in rounded results are expected. These are
not bugs, and will not be fixed.
