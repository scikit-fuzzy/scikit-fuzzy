Readme
======
`scikit-fuzzy` is a fuzzy logic toolkit for SciPy.

The goals of scikit-fuzzy are:
* To provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and implemented fuzzy logic algorithms
* To increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to closed-source options.

IEEE Rounding for Matlab users
------------------------------
It should be noted that Matlab rounds incorrectly. The IEEE standard (which is
how this package behaves) requires rounding to the nearest EVEN number if
exactly between, e.g. 1.5 --> 2; 2.5 --> 2; 3.5 --> 4; 4.5 --> 4, etc. This
minimizes systematic rounding error. Thus, if re-implementing algorithms from
Matlab code, slight inconsistencies in rounded results are expected. These are
not bugs, and will not be fixed.
